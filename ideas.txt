ideas for further development of the game in order to further devlopment my skills.
- scoreboard
- player sprite color change ( based on score )
- simple power ups ( faster shoot speed, insta kill shot, double points, shield, bombs)
- simple debufs ( homing asteroids?)

from boot.dev
- multiple lives/respawning
- explosion affect for the asteroids
- player movement exeleration
- objects wrap around screen instead of disapearing
- background image?
- different weapon types ( laser, shotgun)
- adjust asteroid shape
- change palyer hit box to match sprite
