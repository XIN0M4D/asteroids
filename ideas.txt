ideas for further development of the game in order to further devlopment my skills.
- scoreboard(basic sysem implemented, further development planned)
-hi score board, shows after player is hit, and acts as an intermediary screen before returning to main menu)
- player sprite color change ( based on score )(scrapped idea, plan to use colour change to indicate power up state)
- [
    simple power ups ( faster shoot speed, insta kill shot, double points, , bombs)
    
    )

    

    


    simple debufs ( homing asteroids?, smaller shot)
    dropped by asteroids
    ]

- variable msteroid speeds
- 

from boot.dev
- multiple lives/respawning
- explosion affect for the asteroids
- player movement exeleration
- objects wrap around screen instead of disapearing
- background image?
- different weapon types ( laser, shotgun)
- adjust asteroid shape
- change palyer hit box to match spritew

piercing shots too frequent, lower ammount given per pickup, keep spawn rate as to encourage traversing the map
