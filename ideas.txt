ideas for further development of the game in order to further devlopment my skills.
- scoreboard(basic sysem implemented, further development planned)
-hi score board, shows after player is hit, and acts as an intermediary screen before returning to main menu)
- player sprite color change ( based on score )(scrapped idea, plan to use colour change to indicate power up state)
- [
    simple power ups ( faster shoot speed, insta kill shot, double points, , bombs)
    
    aoe pulse wave (expanding pulse wave, centered on player)

    knockback on impact.
    new method in player. outlined
    new variable in player - pulsewave_charge done
    each asteroid provide pulsewave charge unless charge is @ 100(ammount subject to change)
    pulse activated on key press 'space'
    @ 100 charge pulsewave can be used, removes 100 charge
    circle around player indicating pulse is available.

    


    simple debufs ( homing asteroids?, smaller shot)
    dropped by asteroids
    ]

- variable msteroid speeds
- 

from boot.dev
- multiple lives/respawning
- explosion affect for the asteroids
- player movement exeleration
- objects wrap around screen instead of disapearing
- background image?
- different weapon types ( laser, shotgun)
- adjust asteroid shape
- change palyer hit box to match spritew

piercing shots too frequent, lower ammount given per pickup, keep spawn rate as to encourage traversing the map
